# ecommerce-realtime-log-analytics
E-commerce Real-time Log Analytics uses AWS CI/CD with S3, Lambda, OpenSearch, Glue, Athena, and SNS for real-time log processing and analytics, offering scalable storage, querying, and alerts to enhance e-commerce monitoring and insights.

# Real-time Scalable E-commerce Log Processing and Analytics (AWS CI/CD Pipeline)
This project automates real-time log processing and analytics for e-commerce platforms using AWS services like S3, Lambda, OpenSearch, Glue, Athena, and SNS. Logs are stored in S3, processed by Lambda, indexed in OpenSearch for easy searches, and structured by Glue for Athena queries. If something goes wrong, SNS sends instant alerts. AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy handle deployments seamlessly, ensuring smooth updates. This setup makes monitoring errors, tracking performance, and detecting issues effortless, providing real-time insights without the hassle.

## 1. Project Overview

- E-commerce Real-time Log Analytics is a cloud-native solution that empowers e-commerce platforms to ingest, process, and analyze log data in real time, enabling proactive monitoring, troubleshooting, and insights for enhanced operational efficiency. This project is built using a robust AWS CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration and delivery of updates.

- The architecture leverages Amazon S3 for scalable log storage, allowing for cost-effective data retention and easy retrieval. AWS Lambda is used for real-time log processing, triggering functions as new data is ingested. Processed logs are then indexed and stored in OpenSearch, enabling powerful search capabilities and visualization of logs through Kibana dashboards.

- To facilitate advanced data analytics, the solution utilizes AWS Glue for data cataloging and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations, organizing log data for efficient querying. Amazon Athena is integrated for serverless SQL querying, empowering users to gain actionable insights from the processed logs.

- The entire pipeline is orchestrated using AWS CodePipeline, ensuring automated build, test, and deployment stages. AWS CodeBuild compiles and tests the application, maintaining high code quality, while AWS CodeDeploy handles the deployment to various AWS services. This CI/CD setup accelerates development cycles and reduces time-to-market.

- For alerting and notifications, Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) is configured to send real-time alerts based on specific log patterns or errors, ensuring rapid incident response and improved system reliability.
This solution is designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and cost-effective, leveraging AWS's cloud-native services to handle fluctuating e-commerce traffic. It provides real-time visibility into application health, user behavior, and security threats, driving data-driven decision-making.

- E-commerce Real-time Log Analytics is ideal for businesses seeking real-time log monitoring, data analytics, and continuous deployment on the cloud. Its modular architecture allows easy integration with existing systems, making it a versatile solution for modern e-commerce platforms.

## Architecture Overview

![Actual architecture diagram!](https://github.com/akshayshelke1/ecommerce-realtime-log-analytics/blob/main/architecture/architecture-diagram.png)

The architecture is designed for high availability, scalability, and automation, integrating multiple AWS services for seamless log collection, processing, analytics, and alerting. The key components include:

1.  #### Log Ingestion & Storage: 
- Amazon S3 serves as the central repository for raw and processed logs, ensuring scalability and durability.
- E-commerce application logs (such as user activity, transactions, and errors) are automatically pushed to S3 via API Gateway or directly from the application.

2.  #### Real-time Processing & Transformation:
- AWS Lambda functions process new logs as they arrive in S3, extracting relevant data, filtering unnecessary entries, and transforming them into a structured format.
- Amazon SNS is triggered for real-time alerts when anomalies or critical events are detected.

3.  #### Search & Indexing for Analysis:
- Amazon OpenSearch Service (formerly Elasticsearch) indexes processed logs, enabling full-text search and real-time visualization through Kibana.
- E-commerce teams can search for errors, performance issues, or specific transactions in real time.

4.  #### ETL & Data Cataloging for Structured Analysis:
- AWS Glue automatically crawls and catalogs processed logs, preparing structured datasets for analytical queries.
- The Glue Data Catalog organizes log data into a schema for better accessibility.


5.  #### Query & Insights using SQL
- Amazon Athena provides serverless SQL querying of log data stored in S3, enabling detailed log analysis and trend identification without requiring a database.

6.  #### CI/CD for Deployment & Automation
- AWS CodePipeline orchestrates the build, test, and deployment process for application changes and infrastructure updates.
- AWS CodeBuild compiles and tests updates to ensure stability.
- AWS CodeDeploy automates the deployment of application updates, ensuring zero downtime.

7.  #### Monitoring & Alerting
- Amazon SNS triggers alerts based on specific log patterns (e.g., high error rates, failed transactions, or security threats).
- CloudWatch provides system-level monitoring for Lambda, OpenSearch, and Glue.

## Architecture Flow

</div>


**Step 1: Log Collection & Storage:**
- The e-commerce application generates logs (transaction logs, user activity logs, error logs).
- Logs are automatically sent to an Amazon S3 bucket in raw format.
- S3 Event Notifications trigger an AWS Lambda function whenever a new log file is uploaded.

**Step 2: Real-time Processing & Transformation**
- The Lambda function reads and processes the raw logs, extracting key information such as IP addresses, user actions, product interactions, and error messages.
- The processed logs are stored back in a separate S3 bucket for further indexing and querying.
- If a critical issue is detected (e.g., multiple failed logins, high error rates), Amazon SNS sends an alert via email/SMS.

**Step 3: Log Indexing & Search in OpenSearch**
- A second Lambda function sends processed log data to Amazon OpenSearch for indexing.
- Users can perform full-text searches on logs and visualize trends via Kibana dashboards.

**Step 4: Data Cataloging & ETL using AWS Glue**
- AWS Glue Crawler scans the processed logs stored in S3, identifying patterns and structuring them into tables.
- The AWS Glue Data Catalog organizes log data, making it available for Athena queries.

**Step 5: Querying Logs using Athena**
- Users execute SQL queries on log data using Amazon Athena.
- Example: Querying logs to find all failed login attempts within a time range.
- Athena retrieves data directly from S3, eliminating the need for a traditional database.

**Step 6: Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) Workflow**
- Developers commit code updates to a GitHub repository.
- AWS CodePipeline detects the change and triggers a pipeline execution.
- AWS CodeBuild builds and tests the updated application code.
- AWS CodeDeploy automatically deploys updates to Lambda functions, OpenSearch configurations, or Glue scripts.

**Step 7: Monitoring & Alerts with SNS**
- If a log matches predefined criteria (e.g., error spikes, security threats), SNS sends notifications to relevant teams.
- CloudWatch Metrics monitor Lambda execution times, OpenSearch indexing performance, and Glue job completion.
